Question: How related on a grocery list, is the second item to the first?

In order to solve this we only want groceries list with 2 or more items So we will drop anything with just one item in it

```{r association}
groceries = read.csv("groceries.txt", header=FALSE, sep = ",")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r wrangling, echo=FALSE}
#In order to solve this we only want groceries list with 2 or more items 
#So we will drop anything with just one item in it
groceries <- subset(groceries, V2 != "")


str(groceries)
summary(groceries)

summary_data <- groceries %>%
  group_by(V1) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

# Sort the summary data
sorted_data <- summary_data %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# Select the top 20 most wanted grocery items
top_priority_groceries <- sorted_data %>%
  head(20)

# Create a barplot
barplot(top_priority_groceries$count, names.arg = top_priority_groceries$V1, las = 2, cex.names = 0.6)
```

Once we remove just single item groceries list, whole milk is no longer the top purchased or sought-after item, sausage is with whole milk coming in second. People certainly love the meat!

```{r dedup, echo=FALSE}
groceries_lists = split(x=groceries$V1, f=groceries$V2)
## Remove duplicates ("de-dupe")
groceries_lists = lapply(groceries_lists, unique)

#We convert the list into a transaction object 
groceriestrans = as(groceries_lists, "transactions")
summary(groceriestrans)
```

I have chosen a support of .15 a confidence of .7 and maxlen of 3 to reduce the computation time as before it was taking too long. This will help simplify it.

```{r}
#Run the algorithm 
musicrules = apriori(groceriestrans, 
                     parameter=list(support=.15, confidence=.7, maxlen=3))

inspect(musicrules)
```

Milk is an extremely common staple. Milk has a support of .16-.21 in general based on the first 100 rows. It's confidence goes up with related dairy items like butter milk. But it's confidence also rises when purchasing berries, bread or eggs, which are also staples but not to the extent of milk.

Looking at other relationships...

Meat purchase gives a lift to other meat. E.g. frankfurter, and sausage receive a lift of nearly 2 when someone picks up ham

```{r plot}
plot(musicrules)
```

From this initial plot, we can see that there isn't a clear-cut relationship. Between support and confidence, only that is going up but the lift isn't super big, this is primarily due to the support threshold we chose to minimize computational cost.

```{r plotinspect}

# can swap the axes and color scales
plot(musicrules, measure = c("support", "lift"), shading = "confidence")

# can now look at subsets driven by the plot
inspect(subset(musicrules, support > 0.3))
```

Based on this result, dairy products have the highest support, such as whole milk. But when purchased with other dairy products, the confidence level goes way above. E.G. When yogurt is purchased, the confidence of whole milk goes from .38 to .82
